//Record (store) your data

//Step 2:
//Subtract the drop point from our 'to guess'-value (ex. 300px) and take the absolute value 

//Step 3:
//Sort

//Step 4: 
//Take the K-top records

//Step 5: 
//Calculate the most common bucket (check Lodash)

//Now, how would you implement this using multiple features?
